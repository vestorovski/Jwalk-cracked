<body>
<p>This sub-package for <strong>JWalk 1.0</strong> contains the core JWalk
test engine, &copy; Anthony J H Simons, 2006-2009.
Programmers are not expected to need to interact with components in this
package directly, unless they are building third-party testing tools that
wish to access individual <code>TestSequence</code> objects, in order to
report results in a customised way.  Otherwise, programmers should not
touch the objects in this package.  Doing so might affect the process of
testing in a deleterious way.  Other parts of the <strong>JWalk 1.0</strong>
tool suite are described in the following packages: 
<ul>
<li>The root package <code>org.jwalk</code> is the entry point into the 
JWalk component kit.</li>
<li>The sub-package <code>org.jwalk.core</code> contains the core JWalk 
test engine.</li>
<li>The sub-package <code>org.jwalk.out</code> contains the test reports
emitted by JWalk.</li>
<li>The sub-package <code>org.jwalk.gen</code> contains custom test
input generators.</li>
<li>The sub-package <code>org.jwalk.test</code> contains sample test 
classes.</li>
<li>The sub-package <code>org.jwalk.tool</code> contains finished JWalk
testing tools.</li>
</ul>
The rest of this package documentation gives an overview of the various
<code>JWalker</code> strategy classes that implement the test engine; the 
<code>TestSequence</code>s that these construct, consisting of a number of 
<code>TestCase</code>s that exercise the methods of the test class; and
the various <code>Generator</code>s that synthesise input values for each
<code>TestSequence</code>.
</p>

<h2>The JWalk Test Engine</h2>
<p>The core JWalk test engine consists of a number of test strategy objects,
known as JWalkers.  These are classified in a hierarchy of JWalkers,
according to their abilities to inspect or explore the test class.  
<ul>
<li>org.jwalk.JWalker - the basic strategy, which dispatches the others<ul>
  <li>org.jwalk.core.ClassInspector - extracts the public method interface<ul>
    <li>org.jwalk.core.ProtocolWalker - explores all interleaved methods<ul>
      <li>org.jwalk.core.AlgebraWalker - explores all algebraic constructions</li>
      <li>org.jwalk.core.StateSpaceWalker - explores all states and transitions</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
Each JWalker inherits the capabilities of its ancestors and redefines the main
<code>execute()</code> method.  From the programmer's point of view, the entry
point is the class <code>JWalker</code>, which acts as a dispatcher and launches
the appropriate JWalker subclass, according to the test settings chosen by the
tester.  Each JWalker performs interleaved cycles of test generation, test 
execution and dynamic analysis of the test results.  Feedback from the latest
test cycle is used to inform the JWalker about which paths should be expanded 
in the next test cycle.  The behaviour of the individual JWalkers is described
below.
</p>
<h3>ClassInspector</h3>
<p>This JWalker performs a detailed static analysis of the test class's public
constructor and method interface.  If the test class is an enumerated type,
it extracts the enumerated constants.  It also provides the ability to estimate
the baseline test-set size after exploring the test class breadth-first, to
any bounded depth.  This information is used later to calculate how effective
the test path pruning strategy of other JWalker's has been.  The results of
a <code>ClassInspector</code> are reported in a <code>ProtocolReport</code>.
</p>

<h3>ProtocolWalker</h3>
<p>This JWalker performs a detailed static analysis of the test class's public
constructor and method interface and then explores the test class's constructors
and methods to a given bounded depth.  It then "walks through the protocol", 
meaning that it attempts all constructors, followed by all possible interleaved
combinations of the test class's methods.  In each subsequent test cycle, it 
prunes all those test paths whose prefix terminated in an exception.  This may 
yield a reduction over the baseline test set, if certain methods raised
exceptions.  The initial analysis after class inspection is reported in a
<code>ProtocolReport</code> and the resuts of exploring the protocols of the
test class are reported in a number of <code>CycleReport</code>s, one for
each test cycle of increasing depth, followed by a <code>SummaryReport</code>, 
giving summary statistics.
</p>

<h3>AlgebraWalker</h3>
<p>This JWalker performs a detailed static analysis of the test class's public
constructor and method interface, then performs a dynamic analysis of the 
test class's algebraic structure, by constructing probing paths through the
protocol of the test class and noting whether certain sequences modify the
test object's state, leave it unchanged, or return to a previously visited
state.  The methods of the test class are classified into <em>primitive, 
transformer</em> or <em>observer</em> categories (constructors may be
primitive, or derived also).  Finally, this JWalker explores the test class's
algebraic constructions to a given bounded depth.  It "walks through the 
algebra", meaning that it grows only those test paths that consist of primitive
operations, and examines all operations at the leaves of this tree. In each 
subsequent test cycle, it prunes all those test paths whose prefix terminated 
in an exception, an observer, or a transformer.  This yields a considerable
reduction over the baseline test set.  The initial analysis after class 
inspection is reported in an <code>AlgebraReport</code> and the remaining
results are reported as per <code>ProtocolExplorer</code>, above.
</p>

<h3>StateSpaceWalker</h3>
<p>This JWalker a detailed static analysis of the test class's public
constructor and method interface, then performs a dynamic analysis of the 
test class's high-level state space, using any state predicates supplied in
the test class's interface as hints about its high-level or abstract states.
It does this by constructing probing paths through the test class's algebraic
structure, seeking those paths that cause state predicates to return <code>
true</code> or <code>false</code> in different combinations.  The high-level
states correspond to (possibly a subset of) the boolean product.  Finally,
this JWalker explores the test class's high-level states and transitions to
a given bounded depth.  It "walks the states and transitions" by constructing
the state cover, then extending this with transition paths of increasing
length.  It prunes paths in a similar way to <code>ProtocolExplorer</code>
and generates <code>CycleReport</code>s for each high-level state and
transition path depth.  The initial analysis after class inspection is 
reported in a <code>StateReport</code>, which lists the states and the
state cover, and the remaining results are reported as per 
<code>ProtocolExplorer</code>, above.
</p>
<h2>TestSequence and TestCase</h2>
<p>A single execution path is represented as a <code>TestSequence</code>
that consists of a number of <code>TestCase</code>s.  There are different
kinds of <code>TestCase</code>, classified in a hierarchy according to 
the kind of element that they execute.  The featured classes involved in 
test sequences are:
<ul>
<li>org.jwalk.core.TestSequence - a sequence of abstract TestCase objects</li>
<li>org.jwalk.core.TestCase - an abstract test case to execute an element<ul>
  <li>org.jwalk.core.EnumTestCase - extracts a single enumerated constant</li>
  <li>org.jwalk.core.ParamTestCase - an abstract test case involving parameters<ul>
    <li>org.jwalk.core.CreateTestCase - a test case to execute a single constructor</li>
    <li>org.jwalk.core.InvokeTestCase - a test case to execute a single method</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
Any single <code>TestSequence</code> commences with either a 
<code>CreateTestCase</code> or an <code>EnumTestCase</code>, followed by an 
arbitrary number of <code>InvokeTestCase</code> test cases.  The sequence is
created by a <code>JWalker</code> when the latter is computing the next set
of paths to explore, then populated with actual values just prior to execution.
After execution, the <code>TestSequence</code> may be inspected to determine
a number of properties about the last-executed operation in the sequence.
</p>
<h2>Generators of Test Inputs</h2>
<p>The various <code>JWalker</code> strategy classes construct their chosen
<code>TestSequence</code>s of increasing length, up to the specified bounded
depth.  Prior to executon, each <code>TestSequence</code> must be populated
with actual test inputs, passed as arguments to the constructors and methods 
being executed.  This is achieved using a family <code>Generator</code>s. 
There are two main kinds of <code>Generator</code>, declared as the following
interfaces, with suitable concrete implementations:
<ul>
<li>org.jwalk.Generator - the abstract interface for all test input generators<ul>
  <li>org.jwalk.core.MasterGenerator - the interface for top-level master generators<ul>
    <li>org.jwalk.core.ObjectGenerator - the standard master generator used by JWalk</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>org.jwalk.gen.CustomGenerator - the interface for delegate custom generators<ul>
    <li>org.jwalk.gen.StringGenerator - generates a conventional sequence of strings</li>
    <li>org.jwalk.gen.InterfaceGenerator - generates concrete instances for interfaces</li>
    <li>org.jwalk.gen.EnumGenerator - generates all values of enumerated types</li>
    <li>org.jwalk.gen.PlatformGenerator - generates values with platfom-specific ranges</li>
    <li>org.jwalk.gen.RedirectInGenerator - redirects standard input to a text file</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
A <code>MasterGenerator</code> is a top-level generator which, in addition to
synthesising values of different types, is capable of logging the created
values and mapping from these to a persistent string representation, called
the <em>oracle value</em> encoding.   A <code>CustomGenerator</code> is a
special purpose generator, possibly supplied by the tester, which generates
test inputs for one or more types in a specific way, controlled by the tester.
</p>
<p>The default value-generation strategy synthesises quasi-unique values of
each type, in a monotonically increasing way.  To change this strategy, the
tester may add a <code>CustomGenerator</code> as a delegate of the current
<code>MasterGenerator</code>, to take control of how instances of a specific
type are to be created.  Four custom generators are installed as standard.
The tester may install further custom generators.  See the associated
documentation for the package <code>org.jwalk.gen</code>.
