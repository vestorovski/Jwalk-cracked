JWalk 1.0 Tool Suite
</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This sub-package for <strong>JWalk 1.0</strong> contains sample test
classes for JWalk, &copy; Anthony J H Simons, 2006-2009.  These classes
are provided as test examples to load into the finshed testing tools 
<strong>JWalkTester</strong> and <strong>JWalkUtility</strong>.  They
illustrate different aspects of the tools' performance.  Other parts 
of the <strong>JWalk 1.0</strong> tool suite are described in the following 
packages: 
<ul>
<li>The package <code>org.jwalk</code> is the entry point into the JWalk 
component kit for building JWalk applications.</li>
<li>The package <code>org.jwalk.core</code> contains the core JWalk engine
supporting different test strategies.</li>
<li>The package <code>org.jwalk.out</code> contains the different kinds of
report dispatched by JWalk as output.</li>
<li>The package <code>org.jwalk.gen</code> contains custom generators for
synthesising test inputs.</li>
<li>The package <code>org.jwalk.test</code> contains sample test classes
for loading into the JWalk tools.</li>
<li>The package <code>org.jwalk.tool</code> contains a number of finished
tools for executing JWalk tests.</li>
</ul>
The rest of this package documentation describes how to load and exercise
the various example test classes.  Information on how to execute the two
testing tools <strong>JWalkTester</strong> and <strong>JWalkUtility</strong>
is provided in the package <code>org.jwalk.tool</code>.
</p>
<h2>Loading the Sample Test Classes</h2>
<p>The test classes are all provided as part of the JAR-file download
bundle.  To access the directory containing the compiled test classes,
you must first unbundle the archive, using the file extraction command:
<pre>
	jar -xf JWalk10.jar
</pre>
This will create a package directory structure under the current working
directory.  
</p>
<p>Follow the instructions given elsewhere to launch one of the testing 
tools <strong>JWalkTester</strong> or <strong>JWalkUtility</strong>.
The sample test classes may then be loaded from within the sub-package:
<pre>
	org.jwalk.test
</pre>
Note that this must be used as the package-prefix name for any test class;
simply trying to load them by their short names will not work.
</p>
<h2>Properties of the Test Classes</h2>
<p>Each sample test class has an extensive description of what it is, and
what properties of the testing tools it is designed to reveal.  Refer to
the documentation for each class for the details.  Generally, some classes
expose the ability to discover states, others the ability to interleave
local and inherited methods, and others to optimise the numbers of test
paths generated by the tools.  Some examples exist purely to demonstrate
that the tools can reject pathological cases.  Some examples require the
tester to set one of the custom settings, such as supply a custom 
generator, or alter a standard configuration.
