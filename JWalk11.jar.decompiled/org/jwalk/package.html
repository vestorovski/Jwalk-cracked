JWalk 1.0 Tool Suite
</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This package contains the <strong>JWalk 1.0</strong> lazy systematic unit 
testing tool suite, &copy; Anthony J H Simons, 2006-2009.
This is the root package for the <strong>JWalk 1.0</strong> tool suite, 
containing the component kit for building your own <strong>JWalk 1.0</strong> 
unit testing applications.  The various sub-packages found within this package
contain further components, organised by their function; and one sub-package
contains the finished testing tools <strong>JWalkTester</strong> and 
<strong>JWalkUtility</strong>, which may be executed directly.  In overview:
<ul>
<li>This package <code>org.jwalk</code> is the entry point into the JWalk 
component kit.</li>
<li>The sub-package <code>org.jwalk.core</code> contains the core JWalk 
test engine.</li>
<li>The sub-package <code>org.jwalk.out</code> contains the test reports
emitted by JWalk.</li>
<li>The sub-package <code>org.jwalk.gen</code> contains custom test
input generators.</li>
<li>The sub-package <code>org.jwalk.test</code> contains sample test 
classes.</li>
<li>The sub-package <code>org.jwalk.tool</code> contains finished JWalk
testing tools.</li>
</ul>
If you are seeking to execute one of the testing tools, please refer to the 
instructions immediately below and also the associated documentation for the 
sub-package <code>org.jwalk.tool</code>.
</p>
<h2>Instructions for Use</h2>
<p>This package is provided as an executable JAR-file, whose entry point is
the class <code>org.jwalk.tool.JWalkTester</code>, one of the tools in the
JWalk tool suite.  Launching the JAR-file directly will therefore execute 
<strong>JWalkTester</strong>, a GUI-based Java class unit tester.  This 
tool is described in detail in the sub-package <code>org.jwalk.tool</code>.
</p>
<p>It is also possible to unpack the JAR archive as a tree of packages (this
package and its included sub-packages) and invoke the Java runtime on other
main entry points, such as <code>org.jwalk.tool.JWalkUtility</code>, in 
order to execute <strong>JWalkUtility</strong>, the command-line based Java
class unit tester.  
</p>
<p>In general, this package and its sub-packages (not including 
<code>org.jwalk.tool</code>) constitute a toolkit, out of which developers 
may construct bespoke JWalk testing applications.  The rest of this package 
documentation describes how to incorporate the toolkit in such third-party 
applications.
</p>
<h2>The JWalker Component API</h2>
<p>The following assumes that the developer wishes to build a third-party
application, which incorporates the <strong>JWalk 1.0</strong> testing
engine.  The application is expected to provide its own user interface and
display facilities.  The application will need to interface with some of 
the modular components in this package, <code>org.jwalk</code>, and with
some of the components from sub-packages, in particular 
<code>org.jwalk.out</code>.  
This introduction provides only an overview of how the modular API can be 
used.  Please refer to the more detailed API descriptions for the main 
<code>JWalker</code> test engine and its component APIs <code>Settings</code> 
and <code>Channels</code>.  Many more parameters can be fine-tuned than are 
described in this brief introduction.
</p>
<p>The third-party program will want to load a test class, set the test 
parameters and specify how to receive call-back communications submitted 
by a <code>JWalker</code> in the form of <code>QuestionEvent</code> and 
<code>ReportEvent</code> events.  To do this, the third-party program must 
create an instance of the main <code>JWalker</code> test engine; and then
access its <code>Channels</code> API to set up the communication
channels; and then access its <code>Settings</code> API to supply the 
desired test parameters and upload the test class.
</p>

<h3>Example 1:  Protocol Exploration</h3>
<p>The following fragment illustrates the style of code necessary to set
up the test class, construct a <code>JWalker</code>, register third-party 
listeners, set test parameters and execute a test series.  This example
will explore all method protocols of a <code>Stack</code> class to a 
depth of 4:
<pre>
	Class&lt;?&gt; testClass = Stack.class;   // or by other means

	JWalker walker = new JWalker();
	Channels channels = walker.getChannels();
	Settings settings = walker.getSettings();
	
	channels.addQuestionListener(new MyQuestionListener());
	channels.addReportListener(new MyReportListener());

	settings.setTestClass(testClass);	
	settings.setStrategy(Strategy.PROTOCOL);
	settings.setModality(Modality.EXPLORE);
	settings.setTestPathDepth(4);
	
	walker.execute();
</pre>
The classes <code>MyQuestionListener</code> and <code>MyReportListener</code>
are supplied by the third-party program, according to the interface
specifications in <code>QuestionListener</code> and <code>ReportListener</code>.
These classes may interact with the tester through dialogs, and display the
contents of reports in any desired manner.  See the package documentation for
<code>org.jwalk.out</code> for further details of kinds of reports emitted
by the <strong>JWalk 1.0</strong> tool suite. 
</p>

<h3>Example 2:  Algebraic Exploration</h3>
<p>The following fragment illustrates the style of code necessary to initiate
the algebraic exploration of a <code>Stack</code> class to a depth of 3,
using the <code>JWalker</code> API as before, but this time supplying
slightly different test settings:
<pre>
	String className = "Stack";   // or by other means
	
	JWalker walker = new JWalker();
	Channels channels = walker.getChannels();
	Settings settings = walker.getSettings();
	
	Console console = new Console();
	channels.addQuestionListener(console);
	channels.addReportListener(console);
	
	settings.setTestClass(className);
	settings.setStrategy(Strategy.ALGEBRA);
	settings.setModality(Modality.EXPLORE);
	settings.setTestPathDepth(3);
	
	walker.execute();
</pre>
This uses a default <code>Console</code> object to fulfil both the roles of the
<code>QuestionListener</code> and the <code>ReportListener</code> interfaces.
<code>Console</code> is supplied with the toolkit and it unpacks the various 
communicated events and pipes them to standard output, expecting responses 
from the tester on standard input.  If the third-party program fails to set
any listeners, then <code>Console</code> is used by default in any case.
</p>
<p>This example also illustrates how to set the test class <em>by name</em>, 
rather than by supplying the class object directly.  The test class will be
loaded in the manner specified in <code>Settings.setTestClass(String)</code>.
In particular, Java will search for the test class in the directory currently
specified by <code>Settings.getTestClassDirectory()</code>.  See the 
<code>Settings</code> API for details of how to change this.
</p>

<h3>Example 3:  State-Space Validation</h3>
<p>The following fragment illustrates how a custom generator may be supplied
via the <code>Settings</code> API; and how the directory in which oracles are
saved may be set explicitly (the default is the test class directory).
This fragment will perform state-validation on a <code>Vector</code> class to
a transition path depth of 2, using a user-supplied custom
<code>IndexGenerator</code> as the generator.
<pre>
	Class&lt;?&gt; testClass = Vector.class;       // or by other means
	Class&lt;?&gt; custom = IndexGenerator.class;  // or by other means
	
	JWalker walker = new JWalker();
	Channels channels = walker.getChannels();
	Settings settings = walker.getSettings();
	
	channels.addQuestionListener(new MyQuestionListener());
	channels.addReportListener(new MyReportListener());
	
	settings.setTestClass(testClass);
	settings.addCustomGenerator(custom);
	settings.setOracleDirectory(new File("test/oracles/"));
	settings.setStrategy(Strategy.STATES);
	settings.setModality(Modality.VALIDATE);
	settings.setTestPathDepth(2);
	
	walker.execute();
</pre>
Custom generator classes may be supplied by name, as well as by value, in a 
similar manner to the test class.  More than one custom generator may be
supplied.  In this example, the oracle data file will be saved in the file: 
<code>"test/oracles/Vector.jwk"</code>.  The oracle data file is valid for
retesting using the same generators, but not necessarily for other generators, 
which may synthesise different test inputs in different orders.
</p>
<h2>Handling JWalk Exceptions</h2>
<p>While the JWalk tool suite automatically handles a number of exceptional
cases, such as when one of the tested methods of the test class fails, 
or when memory capacity is exhausted during testing, 
third party software must be able to recognise and possibly
handle the following five kinds of exception.
<ul>
<li><code>LoaderException</code> - raised if the test class, or a custom
generator could not be loaded (wrong pathname given)</li>
<li><code>SettingsException</code> - raised if the third-party software 
supplies invalid test settings (bad constants, out of range values)</li>
<li><code>PermissionException</code> - raised if the test class refuses 
permission to be executed (wrong visibility, security permissions)</li>
<li><code>GeneratorException</code> - raised if test inputs could not be
synthesised, or a generator fails (unknown types, user generator)</li>
<li><code>ExecutionException</code> - raised if any constructor or method
could not be invoked, or behaved randomly (security, nondeterminism)</li>
</ul>
These are the only conditions which actually prevent a JWalker from executing.
The tools warn of other detected events, such as running out of memory, or 
failure to detect all expected states.  All of the above exceptions are
subclasses of <code>JWalkException</code>, so third-party software may
choose to trap just the one exception, or handle them more selectively.
Each kind of exception provides methods to interrogate the cause of the
exception more finely, which may be used to tailor error messages.
