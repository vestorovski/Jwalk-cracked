JWalk 1.0 Tool Suite
</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This sub-package for <strong>JWalk 1.0</strong> contains the JWalk testing
tools, &copy; Anthony J H Simons, 2006-2009.
This package provides a number of finished testing tools, implemented on
top of the <strong>JWalk 1.0</strong> lazy systematic unit testing toolkit.
These include the <strong>JWalkTester</strong> tool, a GUI-based test
generator and execution tool; and the <strong>JWalkUtility</strong> tool,
a command-line driven utility that prints results to standard output.  In
future releases, further tools will be added to this package.   Other parts 
of the <strong>JWalk 1.0</strong> tool suite are described in the following 
packages: 
<ul>
<li>The root package <code>org.jwalk</code> is the entry point into the 
JWalk component kit.</li>
<li>The sub-package <code>org.jwalk.core</code> contains the core JWalk 
test engine.</li>
<li>The sub-package <code>org.jwalk.out</code> contains the test reports
emitted by JWalk.</li>
<li>The sub-package <code>org.jwalk.gen</code> contains custom test
input generators.</li>
<li>The sub-package <code>org.jwalk.test</code> contains sample test 
classes.</li>
<li>The sub-package <code>org.jwalk.tool</code> contains finished JWalk
testing tools.</li>
</ul>
The rest of this package documentation describes how to access and execute
the two tools <strong>JWalkTester</strong> and <strong>JWalkUtility</strong>.
Both depend on a common set of testing concepts, which are explained below.
</p>
<h2>Common JWalk Testing Concepts</h2>
<p>The following concepts are common to all the tools in the <strong>JWalk 1.0
</strong> lazy systematic unit testing toolkit. 
<h3>Test Class</h3>
One unit, a compiled Java
class, may be tested at a time.  This is known as the <code>testClass</code>,
which must always be supplied by the tester and uploaded by the testing tool.  
Other test parameters have suitable default settings, which the tester may 
choose to override.
</p>
<h3>Test Strategy</h3>
<p>The testing can follow different strategies.  The <code>strategy</code> 
parameter is one of: <code>protocol</code>, meaning all interleaved method
protocols; <code>algebra</code> (the default setting), meaning all algebraic 
constructions; or <code>states</code>, meaning all high-level design states.  
The effect of choosing one of these strategies is the following:
<ul>
<li><code>protocol</code> strategy:  JWalk creates test sequences corresponding 
to every possible interleaved ordering of the test class's constructors and 
methods;
</li>
<li><code>algebra</code> strategy: JWalk creates test sequences corresponding 
to every novel algebraic construction, that is, sequences which drive the test
object into novel concrete states;
</li>
<li><code>states</code> strategy: JWalk creates test sequences corresponding
to the state cover, transition cover, and n-switch cover, which drive the test
object through all of its high-level states and transitions.
</li>
</ul>
Novel concrete states are entered when the test object's attributes are set 
to previously unseen values.  Novel high-level design states are entered when
any boolean state predicates provided in the API of the test class return 
different <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> results.
</p>
<h3>Test Modality</h3>
<p>Testing can be conducted to different levels.  The <code>modality</code> 
parameter is one of: <code>inspect</code>, meaning to stop after analysing the
structure and behaviour of the test class; <code>explore</code> (the default
setting), meaning to exercise and display the result of every test sequence
and let the tester interpret each result; or <code>validate</code>, meaning to
verify the result of exercising each test sequence semi-automatically, using 
an incrementally derived test oracle.
</p>
<h3>Test Depth</h3>
<p>Testing can be conducted to different depths.  The <code>depth</code>
parameter corresponds to the maximum length of generated test sequences (the 
default is 3).  In the <code>protocol</code> and <code>algebra</code> modes, 
the depth is the same as the maximum number of methods to be invoked after 
initial construction.  In the <code>states </code> mode, the number of methods 
is counted starting from each high-level design state instead (a prefix 
sequence from the state cover is used to reach each high-level state, which
is extended by each test sequence). 
</p>
<h3>Custom Settings</h3>
<p>Testing can be customised in various ways.  The most common reason for 
doing this would be to take control of how test inputs are synthesised.  
To do this, the tester must supply one or more <code>CustomGenerator</code>s 
that synthesise values in the manner and order desired by the tester.
Other settings can be customised in the different testing tools.
</p>

<h2>The JWalkTester Tool</h2>
<p>The classic <strong>JWalk 1.0</strong> lazy systematic testing tool is
<strong>JWalkTester</strong>, a GUI-based class unit testing tool.  This
is the default tool that is launched when the JAR-file download bundle is
executed directly using the java command:
<pre>
	java -jar JWalk10.jar
</pre>
Alternatively, if the JAR-file archive is first unbundled, using the file
extraction command:
<pre>
	jar -xf JWalk10.jar
</pre>
the <strong>JWalkTester</strong> tool may then be launched using the java 
command:
<pre>
	java org.jwalk.tool.JWalkTester
</pre>
which will access the tool from within the package structure created in
the current directory.  The main frame for the tool should appear, using
the standard look-and-feel of the operating system, centrally in the 
tester's monitor screen.
</p>
<h3>Test Class Panel</h3>
<p>The tester must supply a test class.  The tool gives you the choice of
browsing for a class, or entering the name of the class directly.  Because
of the likelihood of classes being contained in named packages, the test 
class is selected in two stages.  Firstly, the tester must set the working
directory; then select the test class, which may be in the working directory
or in some named sub-package under the working directory.  If an incorrect
path to the test class is specified, the tool will not be able to load the
test class.
</p>
<p>If the test class exists in the default package, then either of the
<em>Browse</em>-buttons may be used to select the class directly, 
and the tool will
sort out the location and the name of the class.  If the test class exists
in a named sub-package, then the top <em>Browse</em>-button 
must be used to set the
location, and the bottom <em>Browse</em>-button 
to select the test class within its
sub-package.  The first text field displays the directory from which the
test class is loaded; and the second text field displays the package-qualified
name of the test class.
</p>
<p>A test class may be specified by typing its package-qualified name
directly into the lower text field.  Any named packages must either be listed
on the standard java <em>CLASSPATH</em>, or exist under the current working
location.
</p>
<h3>Test Settings Panel</h3>
<p>The tester may then supply test settings for the current test series.
These control how the tool executes.  The standard settings may be chosen
from combo boxes and a number spinner:
<ul>
<li>Test Strategy: <ul>
  <li><em>PROTOCOL</em> - exercise all method protocols</li>
  <li><em>ALGEBRA</em> - exercise all algebraic constructions</li>
  <li><em>STATES</em> - exercise all states and transitions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Test Modality: <ul>
  <li><em>INSPECT</em> - just inspect the test class's interface</li>
  <li><em>EXPLORE</em> - also exercise the specified test series</li>
  <li><em>VALIDATE</em> - also validate the results of the tests</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Test Depth: <ul>
  <li>Choose a value from 0..20 for the maximum test sequence length</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
The meanings of each of these settings was explained above, in the section
describing common JWalk testing concepts.
</p>
<h3>Test Execution Panel</h3>
<p>To execute the chosen test series, click on the large animated button,
featuring "JWalking Jimbo", the iconic cartoon character.  While the tool
is busy, the animation will suspend, then resume once testing is over.
Clicking on the test button will cause the current test class and test
settings to be uploaded to the core JWalk test engine.  The first time
the tool is used, there may be a slight delay as Java loads the relevant
classes.  Subsequent re-testing will be quicker.
</p>
<p>In the <em>ALGEBRA</em> and <em>STATES</em> test strategies, the tool will
also perform an initial dynamic analysis of the test class, by executing 
probing sequences.  This may add a further noticeable delay to the perceived
response time.  This can be reduced by altering the <code>probeDepth</code>
parameter in the custom settings.  For very large testing challenges, the tool
may run out of memory and return control to the tester.
</p>
<h3>Custom Generator Dialog</h3>
<p>This is launched by clicking the <em>Generators</em>-button on the 
<em>Custom Settings</em> panel.  The tester may upload any number of custom
generators, in two stages.  First, a java class implementing the generator
must be selected in the upper panel, in the same manner that the test
class was selected above; then, this may be added to the current set of 
custom generators using the <em>Add</em> button in the lower panel.
</p>
<p>The lower panel allows the tester to add or remove custom generators
from the current set.  Clicking on any generator in the current working set 
makes this the selected generator in the upper panel.  
Clicking the <em>Add</em> button adds the
currently selected generator to the working set.  Clicking the 
<em>Remove</em> button removes the currently selected generator from the
working set.  The modifications are uploaded to the core JWalk test engine
when the tester clicks the <em>OK</em>-button.  Clicking the 
<em>Cancel</em>-button will exit the dialog without making any changes.
</p>
<h3>Custom Settings Dialog</h3>
<p>This is launched by clicking the <em>Configuration</em>-button on the 
<em>Custom Settings</em> panel.  The tester may modify a number of additional
settings which usually don't need changing.  These may be chosen using a
combo-box and a couple of number spinners:
<ul>
<li>Test Convention: <ul>
  <li><em>STANDARD</em> - exclude all of Object's methods</li>
  <li><em>CUSTOM</em> - include some of Object's methods</li>
  <li><em>COMPLETE</em> - include all of Object's methods</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Probe Depth: <ul>
  <li>Choose a value from 0..20 for the maximum probe sequence length</li>
</ul></li>
<li>State Depth: <ul>
  <li>Choose a value from 0..n for the tree-depth of object state comparison</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
The <code>Convention</code> parameter affects whether built-in methods from the
root class <code>Object</code> are included in tests (the default is for these
to be excluded).
You can choose to include just the four methods 
<code>equals()</code>, 
<code>hashCode()</code>,
<code>toString()</code> and
<code>getClass()</code>;
or all of<code>Object</code>'s methods, including the thread synchronising 
methods (which raise exceptions in a single thread).
The <code>probeDepth</code> parameter controls how deeply the test class is
explored in the initial probing phase.  This can be raised, if states are 
not being discovered, or lowered if memory is being exhausted.
The <code>stateDepth</code> parameter controls whether object states are
compared for equality in a shallow, or deeper way (the default is 0, meaning 
shallow equality). Raising this causes clusters of reachable objects to be
compared.  The changed configurations are uploaded to the core JWalk test 
engine when the tester clicks the <em>OK</em>-button.  Clicking the 
<em>Cancel</em>-button will exit the dialog without making any changes.
</p>
<h3>Output Panel</h3>
<p>The test results will appear as tabbed panes in the right hand output
panel.  Different tabs may appear for different test strategies, modalities
and depths.  The tabs stack in rows.  Clicking on any tab will bring the 
contents of the tab to the front, and also bring its row of tabs to the front
row.  The tabs contain the following information:
<ul>
<li>Protocol Report - a static analysis of the test class's public 
constructor and method protocols</li>
<li>Algebra Report - a dynamic analysis of the test class's algebraic
structure (<em>ALGEBRA</em> strategy only)</li>
<li>State Report - a dynamic analysis of the test class's high-level
states (<em>STATES</em> strategy only)</li>
<li>Cycle Report - the results of one test cycle (for a given state, in
the <em>STATES</em> strategy), to a given depth</li>
<li>Summary Report - test summary statistics, giving execution behaviour
and (in <em>VALIDATE</em> modality only) validation outcomes</li>
</ul>
The kinds of information presented by these reports are discussed in the
documentation for the package <code>org.jwalk.out</code>.
</p>
<h3>Other JWalk Dialogs</h3>
<p>During execution, the tool will sometimes interact with the tester in
various ways.  The main dialogs are:
<ul>
<li><strong>JWalk Query</strong>: the tool asks the tester to confirm
or reject a particular test sequence during validation</li>
<li><strong>JWalk Notice</strong>: the tool notifies the tester about
an action it has taken, that requires acknowledgement</li>
<li><strong>JWalk Warning</strong>: the tool warns the tester about
a limit that was encountered, that requires acknowledgement</li>
<li><strong>JWalk Error</strong>: the tool reports an error in usage
to the tester, that requires acknowledgement</li>
</ul>
Each of these offers suitable buttons for the tester to respond in
one of the expected ways.
</p>

<h2>The JWalkUtility Tool</h2>
<p>The original <strong>JWalk 1.0</strong> lazy systematic testing tool is
<strong>JWalkUtility</strong>, a command-line utility program for class
unit testing that prints results to standard output.  This tool may be
executed by first unbundling the JAR-file archive, using the file
extraction command:
<pre>
	jar -xf JWalk10.jar
</pre>
and then launching the <strong>JWalkUtility</strong> tool using the java 
command:
<pre>
	java org.jwalk.tool.JWalkUtility
</pre>
which will access the tool from within the package structure created in
the current directory.  A banner should be printed on standard output,
indicating the authorship and version of the tool.
</p>
<h3>Command Line Parameters</h3>
By default, executing the utility with no further command line parameters 
merely prints out a message about correct usage.  The first command 
line parameter must always be the name of the <code>testClass</code> and any 
remaining parameters will be interpreted as further test settings.  These
can be supplied in any order.  Suitable default values are chosen for any
missing parameters.  The compiled class file for the test class must be 
accessible to Java (on the <em>CLASSPATH</em>; or in the current directory).
</p>
<p>The remaining parameters are any of the test <code>strategy</code>, test
<code>modality</code> (values supplied as lower-case strings), the test
<code>depth</code> (supplied as a positive integer) and the name of any custom
<code>generator</code> (supplied as a string in capital-case, as per the usual
naming style for Java classes).  Parameters are processed in the following way:
any integral parameter is treated as the depth.  Any parameter containing the
substring "Generator" is treated as the name of a generator.  Any other 
parameter is expected to name a <code>strategy</code> or <code>modality</code>
(see above for expected values).
</p>
<h3>Executing with Different Settings</h3>
<p>Invoking the command line utility with only the test class named on the
command line will cause the tool to execute with default settings for the
remaining parameters.  For example, the following exercises all algebraic 
constructions of a compiled <code>Stack</code> class (in the current
working directory) to a depth of 3:
<pre>
	java org.jwalk.JWalkUtility Stack 
</pre>
The test strategy, modality and depth of exploration may be changed by 
supplying further parameters on the command line.  For example, the following
explores all high-level states and transitions of a <em>ReservableBook</em> 
to a transition depth of 4:
<pre>
	java org.jwalk.JWalkUtility ReservableBook states 4
</pre>
The high-level states will be determined by natural predicates, such as 
<code>isOnLoan()</code> and <code>isReserved()</code>, in the test class's
API.  Results will be generated for each state and each cycle of increasing
transition path length.
</p>
<p>The following example merely inspects the protocol of a <code>Wallet</code> 
class, in which case the depth parameter for exploration is not relevant:
<pre>
	java org.jwalk.JWalkUtility Wallet protocol inspect
</pre>
The following example causes the tool to interact with the tester.  It
validates the algebraic structure of the <code>Stack</code> class, exploring
to depth 3 and also asking the user to confirm or reject the outcomes of 
certain test sequences: 
<pre>
	java org.jwalk.JWalkUtility Stack algebra validate 3
</pre>
When operating in validation modality, the tool prints out selected test
sequences and requests confirmation of the test outcomes from
the tester, who enters 'y', 'n' or 'q' at the console (carriage return is
interpreted as shorthand for 'y'; entering 'q' quits the current test series).
<h3>Executing with Custom Settings</h3>
<p>The tester can take control of how test input values are supplied to
the test class's methods by supplying one or more custom generators.  The name 
of each custom generator is supplied as a command line parameter in capital 
case, ending with the substring "Generator" to be correctly identified by 
the tool.  The name should refer to a class that satisfies the interface of 
<code>CustomGenerator</code>.  The class must be accessible to Java
(on the <em>CLASSPATH</em>; or in the current directory).
</p>
<p>The following example exercises the method protocols of a compiled 
<code>Vector</code> class, using a custom <code>IndexGenerator</code> that 
generates integer indices in pairs, to allow observation of successive 
<code>put()</code> and <code>get()</code> operations at the same index.
<pre>
	java org.jwalk.JWalkUtility Vector protocol explore 3 IndexGenerator
</pre>
It is assumed that <code>IndexGenerator.class</code> is a compiled Java class
file that is accessible to Java.  This custom generator will be loaded and
installed as a delegate generator.
</p>
<p>Other kinds of configuration settings cannot be changed with the
<strong>JWalkUtility</strong> tool.
</p>
<h3>Output from the Utility</h3>
<p>The tool prints all results on standard output.  After the intitial
banner, the result of inspection is printed, displaying the protocol of the
test class (optionally followed by an analysis of its algebraic structure;
or an analysis of its state space, including the state cover test set).
After this, one or more test cycle reports may be printed, for test cycles
containing sequences of increasing length.  Finally, a test summary report
may be printed, giving summary statistics.  In interactive modes, the
results will appear in blocks, after the tester has completed the confirmations
for that cycle.
</p>
<p>Any notifications or warnings must be acknowledged by the tester (typing
carriage return is understood to mean "OK").  Any oracle file will be
saved in the same directory as the test class.  Any exceptions will be
printed on standard error.
