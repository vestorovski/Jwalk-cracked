JWalk 1.0 Tool Suite
</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This sub-package for <strong>JWalk 1.0</strong> contains custom test 
input generators, &copy; Anthony J H Simons, 2006-2009.  Custom generators 
may be selected by the tester to control how the <strong>JWalk 1.0</strong> 
tool suite synthesises test inputs.  A library of custom generators is
provided here, to which the tester may add their own custom generators.
Several custom generators are loaded by default into the standard
configuration of the <strong>JWalk 1.0</strong> tool suite; others must
be explicitly loaded.   Other parts of the <strong>JWalk 1.0</strong>
tool suite are described in the following packages: 
<ul>
<li>The root package <code>org.jwalk</code> is the entry point into the 
JWalk component kit.</li>
<li>The sub-package <code>org.jwalk.core</code> contains the core JWalk 
test engine.</li>
<li>The sub-package <code>org.jwalk.out</code> contains the test reports
emitted by JWalk.</li>
<li>The sub-package <code>org.jwalk.gen</code> contains custom test
input generators.</li>
<li>The sub-package <code>org.jwalk.test</code> contains sample test 
classes.</li>
<li>The sub-package <code>org.jwalk.tool</code> contains finished JWalk
testing tools.</li>
</ul>
The rest of this package documentation describes the function of generators
and how to construct custom generators.  For information about how to load
custom generators, see the package <code>org.jwalk.tool</code>.
</p>
<h2>Master and Custom Generators</h2>
<p>A <em>custom generator</em> is any Java class that implements the 
<code>CustomGenerator</code> interface.  Such a class may be loaded by
any of the <strong>JWalk 1.0</strong> tools to take control of how input
values are synthesised during testing for the constructors and methods of
the test class.  Reasons for doing this might include:
<ul>
<li>wanting to re-order the default sequence of test values</li>
<li>wanting to specify a particular value sequence for a given type</li>
<li>wanting to specify values for interface and abstract class types</li>
<li>wanting to redirect standard input to read from a text file</li>
<li>wanting to define closely the environment of the test class</li>
</ul>
The <strong>JWalk 1.0</strong> tools use a combination of 
<code>MasterGenerator</code> and <code>CustomGenerator</code> generators to
synthesise all test inputs.  A <code>MasterGenerator</code> synthesises
values using its own standard algorithms, which generate a quasi-unique 
value or object upon each request, but it also delegates requests to supply
values of certain types to <code>CustomGenerator</code>s, which were 
previously added as delegates of that master.  The delegated generators
may synthesise values for one type, or for a group of types, using a
different custom algorithm.  If the tester supplies a home-made
custom generator, this can be made to synthesise values for particular
types in any order desired.  In this way, it is possible to tailor the
testing process to meet the expectations of the test class. 
</p>
<p>
The standard <code>MasterGenerator</code> used by the tools is
<code>ObjectGenerator</code>.  This generator synthesises all basic values
in a quasi-unique monotonically increasing sequence.  Values are only
"quasi-unique", since boolean values will inevitably cycle between 
<code>false</code> and <code>true</code>.  Values for other primitive types
are typically unique, for example, numeric values increase steadily from 1.
Object values will be uniquely instantiated using either their default 
constructor, or the first constructor with arguments that succeeds (the 
arguments are synthesised recursively).  <code>ObjectGenerator</code> 
delegates the synthesis of values for certain types to custom generators.
</p>
<p>Four standard <code>CustomGenerator</code>s are always loaded by the
<strong>JWalk 1.0</strong> tools in the standard configuration, as delegates
of <code>ObjectGenerator</code>.  These include:
<ul>
<li>StringGenerator - generates a conventional sequence of strings</li>
<li>InterfaceGenerator - generates concrete instances for interfaces</li>
<li>EnumGenerator - generates all values of enumerated types</li>
<li>PlatformGenerator - generates values with platfom-specific ranges</li>
</ul>
These take control of how specific types are instantiated.  For example,
there is no automatic means in Java for supplying instances of interface
types, so this must be handled by a custom generator, which maps the
interface type to a suitable concrete type and then requests an instance
of this instead.  Again, the default generation strategy would produce
an empty string, so a custom strategy is used to cycle through a series
of 26 conventional strings, sorted alphabetically.
</p>
<h2>Providing Custom Generators</h2>
<p>
If the tester wishes to supply original custom generators, the following
conventions must be observed.  The custom generator must satisfy the interface
specified by <code>CustomGenerator</code>.  In particular, it must implement
the following abstract methods:
<ul>
<li><code>boolean canCreate(Class&lt;?&gt; type)</code>, reporting whether 
the generator can create values of the requested type;</li>
<li><code>Object nextValue(Class&lt;?&gt; type)</code>, to synthesise the 
next value of the requested type in the expected order; and</li>
<li><code>void setOwner(MasterGenerator generator)</code>, to register its 
owning MasterGenerator.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>The Contract for <em>boolean canCreate(Class&lt;?&gt; type)</em></h3>
<p>This method reports whether the custom generator can synthesise instances
of the requested type.  It should return <code>true</code> for all the class
types that the custom generator can handle, that is, for which it can generate
instances.  This method is called internally, when deciding whether
to delegate a request to the custom generator.  The method should return
<code>true</code>, if the custom generator creates instances of the requested
type, and <code>false</code> otherwise.
</p>
<p>When the standard <code>MasterGenerator</code> receives a request to 
synthesise a value of a particular type, it checks first whether any of its
delegates can create this value.  If so, it forwards the request to the
first delegate found in its list of delegates that is capable of creating the 
value.  The list of delegates is ordered like a stack, such that delegates
that were added most recently take priority over delegates that were added 
earlier by the <code>MasterGenerator</code>.
</p>
<h3>The Contract for <em>Object nextValue(Class&lt;?&gt; type)</em></h3>
<p>This method returns the next value in sequence for the requested type. 
Whereas by default this would be a quasi-unique, monotonically increasing
value on each invocation, custom generators are free to return values in
other orders, so long as the order is completely deterministic and not
random.  So, the sequence could skip or re-order values, or revisit values 
that were returned on a previous invocation.  Random synthesis must be avoided, since
this would defeat the capability of the <strong>JWalk 1.0</strong> toolset
to learn predictable behaviour.
</p>
<p>The requested type must be a type that is acceptable to this custom
generator, i.e. one for which <code>canCreate()</code> returns 
<code>true</code>.  If not, the custom generator should raise a 
<code>GeneratorException</code> reporting failure to synthesise  a value
for the given type.  The result of this method is an object, an array, or a 
"boxed" primitive value.
</p>
<h3>The Contract for <em>void setOwner(MasterGenerator generator)</em></h3>
<p>This method registers a <code>MasterGenerator</code> as the owner of this
custom generator, and is automatically called when this custom generator is
added as a delegate of the <code>MasterGenerator</code>.  In this way, a
custom generator may communicate with the master which owns it.  This can be
useful in the design of certain custom generators, which intercept requests
to handle certain types, but forward some of the requests to their owner.
An example is <code>InterfaceGenerator</code>, which maps from abstract
interfaces to concrete classes, then recursively asks its owner to produce
an instance of the concrete class.
</p>
<p>A custom generator is free to ignore its owner if it so chooses.  Many
custom generators need not communicate with their owner.  In this case, a 
<em>nullop</em> implementation of the method should be provided.
</p>
<h2>An Example Custom Generator</h2>
<p>The following is an example custom generator.  <code>IndexGenerator</code>
takes control of how values are synthesised for the <code>int</code> type.
Instead of a monotonically increasing sequence, it generates repeating pairs
of integers, for use when testing array and sequence types, which may put
and get values at the same index.  Repeating pairs of indices are generated,
so that it might be possible to observe that the value returned by a
<code>get()</code>-method is the value that was previously stored by a 
<code>put()</code>-method at the same index.
</p>
<h3>IndexGenerator: Version 1</h3>
<pre>
import org.jwalk.GeneratorException;
import org.jwalk.gen.CustomGenerator;

public class IndexGenerator implements CustomGenerator {
  private MasterGenerator owner;
  private Object result;
  private boolean repeat = false;
  
  public boolean canCreate(Class&lt;?&gt; type) {
    return type == int.class;
  }
  
  public Object nextValue(Class&lt;?&gt; type) throws GeneratorException {
    if (type != int.class)
      throw new GeneratorException(type);
    if (repeat)
      repeat = false;
    else {
      repeat = true;
      result = owner.nextValue(type);
    }
    return result;
  }  
  
  public void setOwner(MasterGenerator generator) {
    owner = generator;
  }
}
</pre>
<p>This version of <code>IndexGenerator</code> returns pairs of integer values 
in the sequence: <em>{1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, ...}</em>.  It works by synthesising
a new value if the flag <code>repeat</code> is set to <code>false</code>,
otherwise it returns the previous value.  The flag flips between 
<code>false</code> and <code>true</code> on each call.  Note how the actual
<code>int</code> value is created by forwarding a request to the 
<code>owner</code> of this custom generator.  The result is returned as a
boxed-up <code>Integer</code> object.
</p>
<h3>IndexGenerator: Version 2</h3>
<pre>
import org.jwalk.GeneratorException;
import org.jwalk.gen.CustomGenerator;

public class IndexGenerator implements CustomGenerator {
  private int seed = -1;
  private boolean repeat = false;
  
  public boolean canCreate(Class&lt;?&gt; type) {
    return type == int.class;
  }
  
  public Object nextValue(Class&lt;?&gt; type) throws GeneratorException {
    if (type != int.class)
      throw new GeneratorException(type);
    if (repeat) {
      repeat = false;
      return new Integer(seed);  // uses old value
    }
    else {
      repeat = true;
      result = new Integer(++seed);  // uses new value
    }
  }  
  
  public void setOwner(MasterGenerator generator) {
  }   // nullop implementation
}
</pre>
<p>The generator could equally have stored a local integer seed value and
incremented this on every second invocation.  Notice how this version
handles the synthesis rule locally and does not need to communicate with
its <code>owner</code>.  The implementation of <code>setOwner()</code> is
therefore a null operation.  Different in its behaviour from the previous 
version, this custom generator returns pairs of integer values in the sequence: 
<em>{0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, ...}</em>, that is, starting at 0 instead of 1, which
will allow the first array index to be inspected also. 
</p>
<p>The default sequence of integers starts from 1.  This is because 0 is an
identity element for common arithmetical computations.  JWalk's <em>algebraic 
exploration</em> will prune test paths that result in no change to the test 
class, so the standard value-synthesis algorithms try not to generate common
identity elements.  However, when you know that you will be using integers for
testing array indices, it makes more sense to start at zero.
